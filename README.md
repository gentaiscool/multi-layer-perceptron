# multi-layer-perceptron

The repository contains multi-layer perceptron code written in Java. I am trying to implement the code based on "Machine Learning" book by Tom Michell http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html. 

## Features
1. Sigmoid (non-linear function)
2. Backpropagation with weight updating
3. Applies momentum to weight updating
4. Sample: XOR Operation

## Dataset
The program uses dataset which can be downloaded from:
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/ for MNIST in csv form
